# JOSM Strava Heatmap

This browser extension makes it easy to use the [Strava Global Heatmap][1] in
[JOSM][2], [iD][8], and other mapping applications that support TMS imagery.

Accessing this imagery externally requires a set of key parameters that you obtain
by signing into the Strava website, copying the values from several cookies, and
then assembling into a query string at the end of the url.  The keys expire after a
week or so at which point you must repeat the process.  This extension builds the
url for you which makes this weekly process a bit less annoying.

### Manually adding the imagery in JOSM

Copy the url without the `tms:` prefix.  Add a new TMS layer in the [JOSM imagery preferences][6].
Name it Strava Heatmap and paste in the copied url.  If you are updating an expired Strava Heatmap
layer you can just double-click it to replace url in the list view.  In this case, copy the url
*with* the `tms:` prefix as it is required here.

### Manually adding the imagery in iD

Copy the url without the `tms:` prefix.  Open the Backgrounds panel and select "Custom" at the bottom.
Paste the copied url into the Custom Background Settings window that opens.
