# JOSM Strava Heatmap

This browser extension makes it easy to use the [Strava Global Heatmap][1] in
[JOSM][2], [iD][8], and other mapping applications that supports TMS imagery.

Accessing this imagery externally requires a set of key parameters that you obtain
by signing into the Strava website, copying the values from several cookies, and
then assembling into a query string at the end of the url.  The keys expire after a
week or so at which point you must repeat the process.  This extension builds the
url for you which makes this weekly process a bit less annoying.

### Using the imagery in JOSM

Add a new TMS layer in the [JOSM imagery preferences][6].  Name it Strava Heatmap and paste in the
copied url.  If you are updating an expired Strava Heatmap layer you can just double-click it to
replace url in the list view.

### Using the imagery in iD

Open the Backgrounds panel and select "Custom" at the bottom.  Paste the copied url into the
Custom Background Settings window that opens.  Remove the `tms:` prefix at the beginning of
the url so it just starts with `https://heatmap-external- ...`.  This prefix is necessary for
JOSM but must be removed for iD.
